This is a public showcase of the key codes used in Clarke et al. (2024) and Clarke et al. (in prep) to build and analyse LIM tomographies. These codes:
* show how one can extrapolate from an existing, more complete sample
* demonstrate how to use an existing galaxy catalogue to build out models
* make power and cross-spectra
* making and applying masks
Which form key parts of this science

The files are ordered to tell the story of how we manipulate files
Some parts have been redacted (e.g. those relating to specific file locations)
Some simpler parts of the procedure, e.g. developing models, are also not included.
The large data files are also not included
Consequently, some editing and downloading of the required files would be required to run the entire procedure.

Taking catalogue data from e.g. COSMOS2020 data could be processed through this pipeline. This data is sourced from https://cosmos2020.calet.org/ (Weaver et al. 2022). CANDELS data. We also calibrate using CANDELS data from https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/candels (Nayyeri et al. 2017)




Due to data used:
Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under
ESO programme ID 179.A-2005 and on data products produced by CALET and
the Cambridge Astronomy Survey Unit on behalf of the UltraVISTA consortium.
This work is based on observations taken by the CANDELS Multi-Cycle Treasury Program with the NASA/ESA HST, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. (Grogin et al. 2011, Koekemoer et al. 2011).
