This is a public showcase of some of the key codes used in Clarke et al. (2024) and Clarke et al. (in prep) to build and analyse LIM tomographies. These codes:
* show how to make a map from existing catalogue data
* show how to make the power spectra
As well, they show;
* how to make and apply masks to existing maps
* how to extrapolate out from existing galaxy catalogues (including calibrating via CANDELS)
Which each form key parts of this science

Some parts have been redacted (e.g. those relating to specific file locations)
Some simpler parts of the procedure are also not included.
Core of the large data files are also not included, so some editing and downloading of the required files would be required to run the entire procedure.

Taking catalogue data from e.g. COSMOS2020 data could be processed through this pipeline. This data is sourced from https://cosmos2020.calet.org/ (Weaver et al. 2022). CANDELS data. We also calibrate using CANDELS data from https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/candels (Nayyeri et al. 2017)
