This is a public showcase of the key codes used in Clarke et al. (2024) and Clarke et al. (in prep) to build and analyse LIM tomographies. These codes:
* show how one can extrapolate from an existing sample (e.g. CANDELS)
* demonstrate how to use an existing galaxy catalogue to build out models
* make power and cross-spectra
* making and applying masks
Which form key parts of this science
Taking catalogue data from e.g. COSMOS2020 data could be processed through this pipeline
